A simple application to illustrate the Monty Hall problem.

### Background
The Monty Hall Problem gets its name from the TV game show, “Let’s Make A Deal,” hosted by Monty Hall. 
The scenario is such: you are given the opportunity to select one closed door of three, behind one of which there is a prize. 
The other two doors hide “goats” (or some other such “non–prize”), or nothing at all. Once you have made your selection, 
Monty Hall will open one of the remaining doors, revealing that it does not contain the prize2. He then asks you if you 
would like to switch your selection to the other unopened door, or stay with your original choice. 
Here is the problem: Does it matter if you switch?

### Purpose
The purpose of the application is to verify and report to the user that in the “Monty Hall problem”, 
it is statistically beneficial for you to switch choice. To always keep your choice is statistically less beneficial.

### Method
This is implemented as a REST service with integration tests to illustrate the mathematical fact.
